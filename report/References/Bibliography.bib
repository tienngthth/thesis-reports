   abstract = {Program analysis has been increasingly used in software engineering tasks such as auditing programs for security vulnerabilities and finding errors in general. Such tools often require analyses much more sophisticated than those traditionally used in compiler optimizations. In particular, context-sensitive pointer alias information is a prerequisite for any sound and precise analysis that reasons about uses of heap objects in a program. Context-sensitive analysis is challenging because there are over 10 14 contexts in a typical large program, even after recursive cycles are collapsed. Moreover, pointers cannot be resolved in general without analyzing the entire program. This paper presents a new framework, based on the concept of deductive databases, for context-sensitive program analysis. In this framework, all program information is stored as relations; data access and analyses are written as Datalog queries. To handle the large number of contexts in a program, the database represents relations with binary decision diagrams (BDDs). The system we have developed, called bddbddb, automatically translates database queries into highly optimized BDD programs. Our preliminary experiences suggest that a large class of analyses involving heap objects can be described succinctly in Data-log and implemented efficiently with BDDs. To make developing application-specific analyses easy for programmers, we have also created a language called PQL that makes a subset of Datalog queries more intuitive to define. We have used the language to find many security holes in Web applications.},

@article{Jonathan2018,
   abstract = {Writing high-performance code on modern machines requires not just locally optimizing inner loops, but globally reorganizing computations to exploit parallelism and locality---doing things such as tiling and blocking whole pipelines to fit in cache. This is especially true for image processing pipelines, where individual stages do much too little work to amortize the cost of loading and storing results to and from off-chip memory. As a result, the performance difference between a naive implementation of a pipeline and one globally optimized for parallelism and locality is often an order of magnitude. However, using existing programming tools, writing high-performance image processing code requires sacrificing simplicity, portability, and modularity. We argue that this is because traditional programming models conflate the computations defining the algorithm with decisions about intermediate storage and the order of computation, which we call the schedule. },

Profile data collected by JIT compilers at run-time can enable profile-guided optimizations (PGO) to customize the generated native code to different program inputs. AOT compilation removes the speed and energy overhead of online profile collection and dynamic compilation, but may not be able to achieve the quality and performance of customized native code. The goal of this work is to investigate and quantify the implications of the AOT compilation model on the quality of the generated native code for current VMs. First, we quantify the quality of native code generated by the two compilation models for a state-of-the-art (HotSpot) Java VM. Second, we determine how the amount of profile data collected affects the quality of generated code. Third, we develop a mechanism to determine the accuracy or similarity for different profile data for a given program run, and investigate how the accuracy of profile data affects its ability to effectively guide PGOs. Finally, we categorize the profile data types in our VM and explore the contribution of each such category to performance.},

The IR is graph-based and contains nodes fixed to control flow as well as floating nodes. Side-effecting nodes include a framestate that maps values back to the original program. Guard nodes dynamically check assumptions and, on failure, deoptimize to the interpreter that continues execution. Guards implicitly use the framestate and program position of the last side-effecting node. Therefore, they can be represented as freely floating nodes in the IR. Exception edges are modeled as explicit control flow and are subject to full optimization. We use profiling and deoptimization to speculatively reduce the number of such edges. The IR is the core of a just-in-time compiler that is integrated with the Java HotSpot VM. We evaluate the design decisions of the IR using major Java benchmark suites. Copyrightc 2013 ACM.},

As interoperability between programming languages could cause high overhead resulting in a performance loss, it is important to examine how a current polyglot virtual machine with a compiler written in a high-level object-oriented language deals with it. OpenJDK's Project Metropolis presented the GraalVM, an open-source, high-performance polyglot virtual machine, mostly written in Java. This paper presents GraalVM's architecture and its features; furthermore, examining how it resolves common interoperability and performance problems. GraalVM makes software ecosystem productive when combining various programming languages, for example, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Ruby, R, and others. The vital part of GraalVM is the Graal compiler written in Java, which allows developers to maintain and optimize code faster, simpler, and more efficient, in comparison to traditional compilers in C/C++ languages. Graal can be used as a just-in-time (JIT) or as static, ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler. Graal is an aggressively optimizing compiler implementing common compiler optimizations, with emphasis on outstanding inlining and escape analysis algorithms. This paper compares Graal with some of the best-specialized competitors, and presents our results tested within an academic environment.},

When defining the semantics of a programming language, expressions naturally form abstract syntax trees, or, terms. However, in order to facilitate sharing of common subexpressions, modern compilers represent expressions as term graphs. Defining the semantics of term graphs is more complicated than defining the semantics of their equivalent term representations. More significantly, defining optimizations directly on term graphs and proving semantics preservation is considerably more complicated than on the equivalent term representations. On terms, optimizations can be expressed as conditional term rewriting rules, and proofs that the rewrites are semantics preserving are relatively straightforward. In this paper, we explore an approach to using term rewrites to verify term graph transformations of optimizations within the GraalVM compiler. This approach significantly reduces the overall verification effort and allows for simpler encoding of optimization rules.},

We show that proper optimizations in a JIT compiler can widely eliminate overheads imposed by these abstractions. Using the open-source Graal JIT compiler, we achieve speedups of up to 20× on collection workloads compared to the standard HotSpot C2 compiler. Consequently, a sufficiently aggressive JIT compiler allows the language compiler, such as Scalac, to focus on other concerns. In this paper, we show how optimizations, such as inlining, polymorphic inlining, and partial escape analysis, are combined in Graal to produce collections code that is optimal with respect to manually written code, or close to optimal. We argue why some of these optimizations are more effectively done by a JIT compiler. We then identify specific usecases that most current JIT compilers do not optimize well, warranting special treatment from the language compiler.},
