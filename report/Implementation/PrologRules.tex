\section{Prolog Optimization Rules}
\label{sec:rules}
Each optimization in this framework is defined in a Prolog file named after the transformation it performs, such as \texttt{addNode.pl}.
These files contain the logic rules that describe how specific intermediate representation (IR) patterns should be recognized and transformed during compilation.
Stateless optimizations such as canonicalization and loop invariant reassociation are purely pattern based.
They operate by matching structural patterns in the IR and returning transformed results without modifying the knowledge base.
In contrast, stateful optimizations such as conditional elimination require tracking intermediate state during query execution.
These optimizations use Prologâ€™s dynamic capabilities, including fact assertion and retraction, to simulate data flow and propagate information such as possible kwown variable values for conditional elimination optimization.
