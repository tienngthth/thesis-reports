This project approach to integrating Prolog into GraalVM consists of three phases: writing Prolog rules, generating Prolog facts, and querying Prolog for optimization. In the first phase, optimization rules are translated into Prolog predicates, initially focusing on canonicalization and conditional elimination. The second phase involves generating Prolog facts representing the IR nodes and their relationships. The final phase queries the Prolog rules for optimization and transforms the IR accordingly. These phases will be developed in parallel to ensure compatibility between Prolog facts and rules. Existing test suites in GraalVM will be leveraged to ensure the correctness of the integration. For evaluation, optimization throughput will be benchmarked and compared with GraalVMâ€™s existing techniques to assess performance improvements.
