This project's approach to integrating Prolog into GraalVM consists of three phases: writing Prolog rules, generating Prolog facts, and querying and parsing Prolog results for optimization. In the first phase, optimization rules are translated into Prolog predicates. The second phase involves generating Prolog facts representing the IR nodes and their relationships. The final phase queries the Prolog rules for potential optimization and transforms the IR accordingly. A custom Prolog result parser is implemented using recursive descent parsing to parse and convert Prolog output back into IR nodes. These phases will be developed in parallel to ensure compatibility between Prolog facts and rules. Existing test suites in GraalVM will be leveraged to ensure the correctness of the integration.\\
