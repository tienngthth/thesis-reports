This project demonstrated the feasibility of integrating Prolog into the GraalVM compiler for expressing optimizations. The results show that while Prolog provides a clear and expressive way to define optimization rules, performance remains a concern, particularly in stateful and dynamic scenarios such as conditional elimination. Canonicalization, being stateless, benefited from a more efficient integration pattern using a singleton Projog class. Future work will focus on optimizing performance further, potentially by adopting a faster Prolog engine and extending the framework to support more complex optimization patterns.
